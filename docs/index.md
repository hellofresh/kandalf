# Introduction

Kandalf works as a bridge between RabbitMQ and Kafka. It reads messages from provided exchanges in RabbitMQ and sends them to Kafka with intermediate storage for keeping messages in case of Kafka unavailability.

This service is written in Go language and can be build with go compiler of version 1.14 and above.
